Hello, unsuspecting Github user. Welcome to my Clojure learning repository.  
There's nothing much to see here, really. But if you need, here are the references I'm using for my learning:  
[Brave Clojure](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/)
[Exercism](https://exercism.io)
